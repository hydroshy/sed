# 🔴 TCP Response Issue - URGENT FIX NEEDED

## Problem Summary
✅ **Connection:** Working  
✅ **Send:** Working  
✅ **Receive (socket):** Data arriving from device  
❌ **Display (UI):** Message NOT showing on messageListWidget  

## Root Cause Found

**Log Analysis:**
```
Raw data received (26 bytes): b'HELLO from Pico (server)\n'  # ← Data received
Decoded data: 'HELLO from Pico (server)\n'  # ← Decoded OK  
Current buffer: 'HELLO from Pico (server)\n'  # ← Buffer has newline

BUT NO LOG:
- "SPLITTING BUFFER"  
- "_on_message_received CALLED"  
- "on_message" handler fired
```

**Diagnosis:**
Buffer has newline (`\n` present) but split logic **NOT executing**!

## Critical Issues Found

### Issue 1: socket.timeout Handler Bypasses Split
**File:** `controller/tcp_controller.py` line ~165
**Problem:** Exception handler emits entire buffer without splitting!

```python
except socket.timeout:
    if buffer and (current_time - last_data_time) > 1.0:
        self._handle_message(buffer)  # ← WRONG! Sends whole buffer
```

**Impact:** Multi-line buffers like `"HELLO\nPONG\nPONG\n"` sent as one message

### Issue 2: Buffer Timeout Logic Also Bypasses Split  
**File:** `controller/tcp_controller.py` line ~155
**Problem:** 0.5s timeout handler emits buffer without splitting!

```python
if buffer and (time.time() - last_data_time) > 0.5:
    self._handle_message(buffer)  # ← WRONG! No split
```

### Issue 3: Cleanup Logic Doesn't Split
**File:** `controller/tcp_controller.py` line ~199
**Problem:** On shutdown, remaining buffer not split!

```python
if buffer:
    self._handle_message(buffer)  # ← WRONG! No split
```

## Solution Applied

✅ All 3 handlers now SPLIT buffer by `\n` before emit:

```python
while '\n' in buffer:
    line, buffer = buffer.split('\n', 1)
    self._handle_message(line)  # ← Emit individual lines
```

## Files Modified

- `controller/tcp_controller.py`:
  - Line ~155: Buffer timeout - now splits
  - Line ~165: Socket timeout - now splits  
  - Line ~199: Cleanup - now splits

## Expected After Fix

```
Raw data received: b'HELLO\nPONG\nPONG\n'
   ↓
Decoded + split
   ↓  
★ SPLITTING BUFFER!
Processing line: 'HELLO'
Processing line: 'PONG'
Processing line: 'PONG'
   ↓
★★★ _on_message_received CALLED! HELLO
★★★ _on_message_received CALLED! PONG
★★★ _on_message_received CALLED! PONG
   ↓
UI shows:
RX: HELLO
RX: PONG
RX: PONG
```

## Test Status

❌ Test incomplete - app not fully responding
⏳ Awaiting full test run with device

## Next Steps

1. Run `python run.py`
2. Connect to device
3. Send command
4. Verify "RX:" messages appear
5. Check console for "SPLITTING BUFFER" logs

**Status:** 🔴 CRITICAL - Awaiting test  
**Severity:** HIGH - Blocks all TCP RX  
**ETA:** Immediate after code fix
