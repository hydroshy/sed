# ✅ QUICK FIX VERIFICATION

## What Was Fixed

**Issue:** `ToolManager has no attribute 'get_tool_by_name'`  
**Fix:** Use `camera_manager.current_mode` instead  
**File:** `gui/tcp_controller_manager.py`  
**Lines:** 200-251

## Verification Checklist

### ✅ Code Changes
- [x] Removed `tool_manager.get_tool_by_name()` calls
- [x] Added direct `camera_manager.current_mode` check
- [x] Proper error handling for missing attributes
- [x] Comprehensive logging at each decision point

### ✅ Logic Flow
- [x] Parse message for "start_rising"
- [x] Check camera_manager exists
- [x] Check current_mode == 'trigger'
- [x] Call activate_capture_request() if all checks pass
- [x] Log success/failure

### ✅ No Breaking Changes
- [x] _on_message_received() still called
- [x] Message still displayed in list
- [x] All error paths handled gracefully
- [x] Backward compatible with existing code

## How to Test

```bash
# 1. Start app
python run.py

# 2. Set to trigger mode (click button in GUI)

# 3. Connect to TCP (192.168.1.190:4000)

# 4. Sensor sends: start_rising||2075314

# 5. Look in console for:
# ★ Detected trigger command: start_rising||2075314
# ★ Camera is in trigger mode, triggering capture
# ✓ Camera triggered successfully
```

---

## Expected Console Output (After Fix)

```
★ Detected trigger command: start_rising||2075314
★ Camera is in trigger mode, triggering capture for: start_rising||2075314
★ Calling camera_manager.activate_capture_request()
✓ Camera triggered successfully for message: start_rising||2075314
```

**NOT seeing this error anymore:**
```
❌ AttributeError: 'ToolManager' object has no attribute 'get_tool_by_name'
```
