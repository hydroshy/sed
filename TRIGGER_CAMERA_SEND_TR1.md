# 💡 Trigger Camera → Send TR1 to Light Controller

## 🎯 Feature Overview

When you click the **"Trigger Camera"** button, the system now automatically sends a **"TR1"** command to the light controller (if it's connected).

This allows you to:
- 📸 Capture images with the camera
- 💡 Trigger light/signal simultaneously via TCP
- ⏱️ Ensure precise synchronization between camera and light

## 🔧 How It Works

### Flow Diagram
```
User clicks "Trigger Camera" button
    ↓
on_trigger_camera_clicked() called
    ├─ NEW: _send_trigger_to_light_controller() invoked
    │   ├─ Check if light_controller exists
    │   ├─ Check if connected to light device
    │   └─ Send "TR1" command via TCP
    │
    ├─ Capture image from camera
    └─ Update UI
```

### Implementation Details

**Modified File**: `gui/camera_manager.py`

**Changes**:
1. Added `_send_trigger_to_light_controller()` method (~35 lines)
2. Called from `on_trigger_camera_clicked()` method

**New Method**:
```python
def _send_trigger_to_light_controller(self):
    """💡 Send TR1 command to light controller when trigger button is clicked"""
    # Validates light controller exists and is connected
    # Sends "TR1" command via TCP
    # Logs success/failure with 💡 indicators
```

## 📋 Usage

### Prerequisites
1. Light controller must be connected (see Light Controller tab)
2. Status label should show green "Connected"
3. Camera must be in trigger mode

### Steps
1. Open **Light Controller** tab
2. Enter IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.100`)
3. Enter port (e.g., `5000`)
4. Click **"Connect"** button
5. Status should turn green ✓

Then in the **Camera** view:
1. Click **"Trigger Camera"** button
2. ✅ Image captures AND "TR1" sent to light device simultaneously

### Console Output

**Success**:
```
DEBUG: [CameraManager] Trigger camera button clicked
💡 Sent TR1 command to light controller
DEBUG: [CameraManager] ✓ TR1 sent to light controller
```

**Light not connected**:
```
DEBUG: [CameraManager] Trigger camera button clicked
DEBUG: [CameraManager] Light controller not connected
```

**Error**:
```
DEBUG: [CameraManager] Error sending TR1: [error message]
💡 Error sending TR1 to light controller: [error details]
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Test 1: Basic Trigger Without Light Device
```
Steps:
1. Run app: python run.py
2. Click Trigger Camera button
3. Check console for messages

Expected: ✅ Should say "Light controller not connected" (expected if no device)
Actual: [   ]
```

### Test 2: Trigger With Light Device Connected
```
Steps:
1. Connect to light device in Light Controller tab
2. Check that status is green "Connected"
3. Click Trigger Camera button
4. Check message history in Light Controller tab

Expected: ✅ Message "→ TR1" should appear in Light Controller message list
Actual: [   ]
```

### Test 3: Trigger Command Received
```
Steps:
1. Monitor light device for incoming TR1 command
2. Click Trigger Camera button
3. Check if light device received "TR1"

Expected: ✅ Light device processes TR1 command
Actual: [   ]
```

## 🔍 Code Location

**File**: `gui/camera_manager.py`

**Methods**:
1. **`on_trigger_camera_clicked()`** (line ~1852)
   - Added call to `_send_trigger_to_light_controller()` at the start
   - Original camera trigger logic unchanged

2. **`_send_trigger_to_light_controller()`** (line ~2505)
   - New method
   - Checks light controller existence
   - Validates connection
   - Sends "TR1" command
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Detailed logging

## ⚙️ Implementation Details

### Logic Flow
```python
def on_trigger_camera_clicked(self):
    # NEW: Send TR1 command first
    self._send_trigger_to_light_controller()  # ← Added
    
    # EXISTING: Camera capture logic
    self.activate_capture_request()
    self.update_camera_mode_ui()
```

### Light Controller Integration
```python
def _send_trigger_to_light_controller(self):
    # 1. Get tcp_controller from main_window
    tcp_manager = self.main_window.tcp_controller
    
    # 2. Get light_controller from tcp_manager
    light_controller = tcp_manager.light_controller
    
    # 3. Check if connected
    if light_controller.is_connected:
        # 4. Send TR1 command
        light_controller.send_message("TR1")
```

## 🎯 Key Features

✅ **Automatic Synchronization**
- Light and camera trigger happen together
- No manual coordination needed

✅ **Connection Validation**
- Checks if light device is connected before sending
- Gracefully handles disconnected state
- No errors or crashes

✅ **Comprehensive Logging**
- Success messages with 💡 indicator
- Failure/warning messages logged
- Error details captured
- Console output for debugging

✅ **Non-Blocking**
- TR1 command sent quickly
- Doesn't delay camera capture
- Both operations work independently

## 📝 Command Format

**Command**: `TR1`
- Length: 3 bytes
- Type: ASCII text
- Terminator: `\n` (added by tcp_light_controller)

**Full message sent**: `TR1\n`

## 🔄 Related Components

**Dependencies**:
- `tcp_light_controller.send_message()` - Sends command via TCP
- `light_controller.is_connected` - Checks connection status
- `camera_manager.on_trigger_camera_clicked()` - Original trigger handler

**Integrates With**:
- Light Controller tab (UI for connecting)
- TCP Light Controller (TCP communication)
- Camera Manager (trigger logic)

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What if light controller is not connected?**
A: Command is silently skipped (logged as debug). Camera trigger still works.

**Q: Can I disable this feature?**
A: Yes, the check `if light_controller.is_connected:` prevents sending if not connected. To fully disable, set light to disconnected state.

**Q: Does this affect camera performance?**
A: No, TR1 command is sent asynchronously. Camera capture is not delayed.

**Q: What if the light device doesn't recognize "TR1"?**
A: You can change "TR1" to any other command string by modifying the code. The device should respond accordingly based on its protocol.

**Q: Can I send different commands?**
A: Yes! Change `light_controller.send_message("TR1")` to `light_controller.send_message("YOUR_COMMAND")` in the code.

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. ✅ Feature implemented
