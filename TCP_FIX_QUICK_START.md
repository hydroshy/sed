## 🚀 Test Immediately

### 1. Start App
```powershell
cd e:\PROJECT\sed
python run.py
```

### 2. Connect to Device
- Go to "Controller" tab
- Enter IP: `192.168.1.190`
- Enter Port: `4000`
- Click "Connect"
- Wait for "Status: Connected" (green)

### 3. Send Command
- Type in message box: `PING`
- Press Enter or click "Send"

### 4. Verify Response
👀 **Look for:**
- In messageListWidget: `RX: PONG` appears below your `TX: PING`
- In console: "SPLITTING BUFFER" logs
- Multiple responses show as separate lines

---

## 📊 Expected Output

### Console Should Show:
```log
2025-10-21 11:30:34,147 - root - INFO - ★ Sending message: 'PING'
2025-10-21 11:30:34,147 - root - INFO - ✓ Message sent successfully

2025-10-21 11:30:34,181 - root - DEBUG - Raw data received (6 bytes): b'PONG\n'
2025-10-21 11:30:34,181 - root - DEBUG - Decoded data: 'PONG\n'
2025-10-21 11:30:34,181 - root - INFO - ★ SPLITTING BUFFER! Iteration 1
2025-10-21 11:30:34,181 - root - INFO - Processing line from buffer: 'PONG'
2025-10-21 11:30:34,181 - root - INFO - _handle_message called with: 'PONG'
2025-10-21 11:30:34,181 - root - INFO - Emitting signal - message_received.emit('PONG')
2025-10-21 11:30:34,181 - root - INFO - ★★★ _on_message_received CALLED! message='PONG' ★★★
2025-10-21 11:30:34,181 - root - INFO - Adding message to list: RX: PONG
```

### UI Should Show:
```
TX: PING
RX: PONG
RX: PONG
RX: PONG
```

## ✅ Success Checklist

After running test:
- [ ] RX messages appear in messageListWidget
- [ ] Each device response is a separate line
- [ ] No messages stuck together
- [ ] Console shows "SPLITTING BUFFER" logs
- [ ] No errors or exceptions

---

## ❌ If It Doesn't Work

### Problem: RX still doesn't appear
**Check:**
1. Is device actually running? (check device console)
2. Does device respond to PING? (test with external TCP client)
3. Check console for errors (scroll up)

### Problem: Messages show but all on one line
- That's a UI formatting issue, not this fix
- Check messageListWidget configuration

### Problem: Console has errors
- Please share the error message
- Look for red text in console

## 📂 Files Changed

Only ONE file modified:
- `controller/tcp_controller.py`

Three sections updated (Lines ~162, ~185, ~205):
1. Buffer timeout handler - Added split logic
2. Socket timeout handler - Added split logic
3. Thread cleanup handler - Added split logic

---

## 💾 Backup

If you want to revert, backup was made of original file.

---

## 📞 Support

If test fails:
1. Note exact symptoms
2. Copy error from console
3. Check that device is responding
4. Try with external TCP client first (to isolate from GUI)

**Ready to test? Run:** `python run.py`

🟢 **Fix Status:** DEPLOYED & READY
