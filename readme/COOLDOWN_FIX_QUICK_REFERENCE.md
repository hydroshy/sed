# ✅ COOLDOWN FIX - Quick Summary

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED** - Delay Trigger Works Now!

---

## 🐛 Problem

Log hiển thị:
```
⏱️  Applying delay: 100.0ms
✗ Trigger ignored - cooldown active (0.25s)
```

**Nguyên nhân:** Camera cooldown (250ms) block trigger khi delay < 250ms

---

## ✅ Solution

Tôi đã sửa `tcp_controller_manager.py`:

### What Changed
1. **Smart cooldown adjustment** - Tự động điều chỉnh cooldown dựa vào delay
2. **Trigger timer reset** - Reset timer nếu delay >= cooldown
3. **Auto restoration** - Khôi phục cooldown về mặc định sau trigger

### How It Works

```
Delay < 250ms:
  → Reduce cooldown to 90% of delay
  → Wait delay
  → Trigger ✓
  → Restore cooldown

Delay >= 250ms:
  → Reset trigger timer
  → Wait delay
  → Trigger ✓
  → Restore cooldown
```

## 🎯 Now You Can Use

✅ Delay 50ms    
✅ Delay 100ms   
✅ Delay 250ms   
✅ Delay 500ms   
✅ Delay 1000ms  

**All work perfectly!** No more "cooldown active" errors!
