# ⚡ Quick Fix - Threshold Debugging

## Status: ✅ Debugging Logs Added

I've added comprehensive logging to track thresholds from UI table → DetectTool initialization.

---

## What Changed

### 1. **detect_tool_manager.py** - Added 3 logs to `get_class_thresholds()`
```python
logger.info(f"Reading thresholds from table - Rows: {self.classification_model.rowCount()}")
logger.info(f"  Row {row}: {class_name} = {threshold}")
logger.info(f"Final thresholds dict: {thresholds}")
```

### 2. **detect_tool_manager.py** - Added 1 log to `get_tool_config()`
```python
logger.info(f"get_tool_config() - Thresholds from table: {thresholds}")
```

### 3. **detect_tool.py** - Added 1 log to factory function
```python
logger.info(f"  Class thresholds: {tool_config.get('class_thresholds', {})}")
```

### 4. **detect_tool.py** - Added 1 log to `initialize_detection()`
```python
logger.info(f"  Thresholds: {self.class_thresholds}")
```

## How to Test

1. Run application: `python run.py`
2. Go to Detect Tab
3. Select model
4. Add class: Select "pilsner333" → Click Add
5. Edit threshold: Double-click "0.5" → Change to "0.8" → Enter
6. Click **Apply** button
7. **Check console for threshold logs** ✓

---

## What Logs Should Show

When you click Apply:
```
Reading thresholds from table - Rows: 1
  Row 0: pilsner333 = 0.8
Final thresholds dict: {'pilsner333': 0.8}
get_tool_config() - Thresholds from table: {'pilsner333': 0.8}
Created DetectTool from manager config
  Class thresholds: {'pilsner333': 0.8}
⚙️  DetectTool initialized, starting detection...
  Thresholds: {'pilsner333': 0.8}
```

If you see `{'pilsner333': 0.8}` in all these logs, thresholds are working! ✅

If any shows `{}` (empty), that's where the problem is.

## Send Me These Logs

When you run the test:
1. Add class with threshold 0.8
2. Click Apply
3. Trigger a capture
4. Copy-paste the console output

I can then pinpoint exactly what's happening and fix it.
