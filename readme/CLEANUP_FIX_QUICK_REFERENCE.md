# 🔧 QUICK CLEANUP FIX REFERENCE

## ✅ The Issue

```
WARNING - Error cleaning up camera stream: 
'CameraStream' object has no attribute 'cleanup'
```

## ✅ The Fix

Added `cleanup()` method to `CameraStream` class in `camera/camera_stream.py`

### What It Does
```python
def cleanup(self):
    """
    Clean up camera resources and stop all operations.
    Safe to call multiple times.
    """
```

### Cleanup Operations
1. Stops live capture if active
2. Stops live worker thread
3. Stops timer
4. Closes picamera2 camera
5. Comprehensive error handling

### Key Features
- ✅ Safe to call multiple times
- ✅ Won't throw exceptions
- ✅ Properly releases all resources
- ✅ Uses hasattr() for safety
- ✅ Each step wrapped in try-except

## ✅ Call Chain
