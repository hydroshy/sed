## üîç The Fix at a Glance

### Problem
Data arriving from TCP device but not displaying on messageListWidget

### Root Cause
Buffer not being split by newlines in 3 timeout/cleanup handlers

### Solution
Added buffer split logic to all 3 handlers

### File Modified
`controller/tcp_controller.py` (Lines ~162, ~185, ~205)

### Status
‚úÖ COMPLETE & READY TO TEST

---

## üöÄ Quick Test

```bash
cd e:\PROJECT\sed
python run.py
```

1. Connect to device (192.168.1.190:4000)
2. Send: PING
3. Verify: "RX: PONG" appears
4. Check console: "SPLITTING BUFFER" logs

---

## üìä Impact Summary

### What's Fixed
- ‚úÖ Multi-line device responses now display as separate items
- ‚úÖ Socket timeout handler now splits buffer
- ‚úÖ Buffer timeout handler now splits buffer
- ‚úÖ Cleanup handler now splits buffer

### What's NOT Changed
- No network changes
- No API changes
- No signal changes
- Backward compatible 100%

---

## üéì Key Concepts

### Why This Matters
When device sends multiple lines separated by `\n` characters, they need to be emitted as separate messages, not stuck together!

### What Was Wrong
Code had split logic in main loop but NOT in exception handlers
‚Üí When socket timeout occurred, code jumped to handler that didn't split
‚Üí Result: Multi-line messages stuck together

### How It's Fixed
Same split logic now applied to ALL buffer emission points:
1. Main receive loop
2. Buffer timeout handler
3. Socket timeout handler  
4. Thread cleanup handler

## üß™ Testing Checklist

Before testing:
- [ ] Device is powered on
- [ ] Device listens on configured IP/port
- [ ] Device responds to test commands

During testing:
- [ ] App connects successfully
- [ ] TX messages appear when sending
- [ ] RX messages appear when device responds
- [ ] Multiple responses show as separate items
- [ ] Console shows "SPLITTING BUFFER" logs

---

## üîÑ Process Summary

### What Was Done
1. Analyzed console logs showing data arriving but not displaying
2. Identified 3 locations where buffer wasn't being split
3. Applied same split logic to all 3 locations
4. Added comprehensive logging for verification
5. Created detailed documentation

### What You Do Next
1. Run: `python run.py`
2. Test with device
3. Verify RX messages appear
4. Check console logs
5. Report success or issues
