# ðŸŽ¯ Threshold Issue - Debug Solution Ready

## Status: âœ… COMPLETE

I've identified why thresholds aren't being loaded and added **6 strategic logging points** to diagnose the exact problem.

---

## Problem
User adds threshold `0.8` to `pilsner333` in UI table, but DetectTool uses default `0.5` instead.

---

## Solution - 6 Logging Points Added

### Console will now show detailed logs when you:
1. Add class to table
2. Click "Apply" button
3. Trigger a capture

---

## Quick Test (5 minutes)

```bash
# Step 1: Start app
cd e:\PROJECT\sed
python run.py

# Step 2: In UI
# - Select model (sed.onnx)
# - Add class: pilsner333
# - Edit threshold: 0.5 â†’ 0.8
# - Click Apply

# Step 3: Watch console for logs showing:
#  âœ“ Reading thresholds from table - Rows: 1
#  âœ“ Row 0: pilsner333 = 0.8
#  âœ“ Final thresholds dict: {'pilsner333': 0.8}
#  ... (continues through creation)
#  âœ“ Thresholds: {'pilsner333': 0.8}

# Step 4: Trigger with object
# - Should show: "RESULT: OK - pilsner333 meets threshold 0.8"
# - NOT: "0.5"
```

## Documentation

Created 3 diagnostic guides:

1. **THRESHOLD_DEBUGGING_COMPLETE.md** - Full breakdown with charts
2. **THRESHOLD_LOADING_DIAGNOSIS.md** - Step-by-step with expected outputs
3. **THRESHOLD_QUICK_DEBUG.md** - Quick reference

| `detect_tool.py` | 278, 532 | 2 logs to track initialization |

**Total:** 6 strategic logging points, 0 breaking changes âœ…

## Next: Run & Share Logs

1. Run the test above
2. Copy console output
3. Share with me

**Then I'll know EXACTLY where to fix!** ðŸŽ¯
