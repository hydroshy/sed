## 🎯 Bug Fix Summary

### The Problem
When editing DetectTool already in job:
- Config lost: `selected_classes` = [] (EMPTY)
- Table empty: No classes shown
- Can't modify: Nothing to edit

### The Root Cause
```
_on_add_classification() → adds to TABLE but NOT LIST
→ selected_classes list stays EMPTY
→ Config saves with empty list
→ Can't restore on edit
```

### The Solution
```
✅ Sync TABLE ↔ LIST on add operations
✅ Sync TABLE ↔ LIST on remove operations
✅ Remove unnecessary detection area logic
✅ Add missing imgsz parameter
```

### The Result
```
✅ Classes sync between TABLE and LIST
✅ Config now has selected_classes populated
✅ Edit tool restores all configuration
✅ Config persistence FIXED
```
