## 🎓 KEY FINDINGS

### The Bug
```
selected_classes list NOT synced with table
→ Config saved with empty list
→ Can't restore on edit
→ Everything appears lost
```

### The Root Cause
```
_on_add_classification() adds to TABLE but NOT LIST
Missing: self.selected_classes.append()
Result: Data mismatch
```

### The Solutions
```
1. Sync on add: Add to both TABLE and LIST
2. Sync on remove: Remove from both TABLE and LIST
3. Simplify config: Remove detection area (not needed)
4. Add parameter: Include imgsz for YOLO
```
