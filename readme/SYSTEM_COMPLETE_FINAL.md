## 🔄 Complete Data Flow

```
USER INTERACTION
  ↓
[Detect Tab] Select model + class + threshold
  ↓
[Apply Button] Create and add DetectTool + ResultTool
  ↓
Job contains 3 tools: [Camera Source, Detect Tool, Result Tool]
  ↓
[Camera Tab] Click Trigger
  ↓
PIPELINE EXECUTION
  ├─ Camera Source
  │   Input: Frame from camera
  │   Output: Frame + metadata
  │   ↓
  ├─ Detect Tool
  │   Input: Frame + {class_thresholds, selected_classes}
  │   Output: detections (with class_thresholds, selected_classes)
  │   ↓
  └─ Result Tool
      Input: detections + {class_thresholds, selected_classes}
      Processing: Compare confidence >= threshold for each class
      Output: ng_ok_result ('OK' or 'NG'), ng_ok_reason
      ↓
RESULT RECORDING
  ├─ Update main execution label (executionLabel) - GREEN/RED
  ├─ Record result to ResultManager.frame_status_history
  ├─ Update review labels (reviewLabel_1 to reviewLabel_5)
  └─ Display frame in review view
      ↓
UI DISPLAY
  ├─ Main status: OK ✅ (GREEN) or NG ❌ (RED)
  └─ Review frame history:
      reviewLabel_1: NG (RED)
      reviewLabel_2: OK (GREEN)
      ...
      reviewLabel_5: OK (GREEN) ← Most recent
```

## 📊 System Architecture

```
UI Layer
├─ Main Window
├─ Camera Manager (manages frame capture & job execution)
├─ Detect Tool Manager (model selection, class/threshold config)
└─ Result Manager (tracks frame history & status)
        ↓
Job Manager
├─ Current Job: [Camera Source, Detect Tool, Result Tool]
├─ Tool Pipeline: Sequential execution with context passing
└─ Result Collection: Nested results structure
        ↓
Tool Layer
├─ Camera Tool (frame source)
├─ Detect Tool (YOLO inference)
└─ Result Tool (threshold evaluation)
        ↓
Detection Layer
├─ ONNX Runtime (model execution)
├─ Model: sed.onnx (480x640 input)
└─ Classes: pilsner333, corona, heineken
```

## 🔧 All Fixes Applied (Session Summary)

| # | Issue | Fix | Status |
|---|-------|-----|--------|
| 1 | Thresholds not loading | Added config passing through factory | ✅ |
| 2 | ResultTool not in pipeline | Auto-add when Apply clicked | ✅ |
| 3 | UI reading wrong data structure | Access nested job_results['results'] | ✅ |
| 4 | Main label showing NG instead of OK | Read from ResultTool output in job_results | ✅ |
| 5 | Review labels not updating | Record result to ResultManager history | ✅ |

**Total:** 5 critical issues identified and fixed

---

## 📝 Files Modified (This Session)

| File | Changes | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| `gui/detect_tool_manager.py` | Auto-add ResultTool | ✅ |
| `tools/result_tool.py` | Added logging | ✅ |
| `gui/camera_manager.py` | Fixed data structure + recording to history | ✅ |

**Total:** 3 files, ~150 lines modified
