# ✅ TCP AUTO-TRIGGER FIX - DEPLOYMENT READY

## Issue Fixed ✅

**Problem:** `AttributeError: 'ToolManager' object has no attribute 'get_tool_by_name'`

**Cause:** Incorrect method call to access camera mode

**Solution:** Use `camera_manager.current_mode` directly

**File:** `gui/tcp_controller_manager.py` (lines 200-251)

---

## What Was Changed

### Old Code (Broken)
```python
camera_tool = self.main_window.tool_manager.get_tool_by_name("Camera Source")  # ❌ Fails
```

### New Code (Fixed)
```python
camera_manager = self.main_window.camera_manager  # ✅ Works
if camera_manager.current_mode != 'trigger':    # ✅ Correct check
    return
```

## How It Works Now

```
TCP: "start_rising||2075314"
           ↓
Detected by _on_message_received()
           ↓
Check: "start_rising" in message? ✅
Check: camera_manager exists? ✅
Check: current_mode == 'trigger'? ✅
           ↓
camera_manager.activate_capture_request()
           ↓
📸 FRAME CAPTURED
```

---

## Console Output (Success)

```log
★ Detected trigger command: start_rising||2075314
★ Camera is in trigger mode, triggering capture
✓ Camera triggered successfully for message: start_rising||2075314
```

## Next Steps to Deploy

### 1. Copy the Fixed File
```bash
# Transfer to Raspberry Pi
scp gui/tcp_controller_manager.py pi@192.168.1.190:/home/pi/Desktop/project/sed/gui/
```

### 2. Start the Application
```bash
python run.py
```

### 3. Test the Feature
1. Set camera to **Trigger Mode** (click button in GUI)
2. Connect to TCP device (192.168.1.190:4000)
3. Send test message: `start_rising||2075314`
4. Verify in console:
   - Message received ✅
   - "Detected trigger command" ✅
   - "Camera triggered successfully" ✅
5. Check UI:
   - Message displayed ✅
   - `[TRIGGER]` event shown ✅
   - Frame captured ✅

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Camera doesn't trigger
**Solution:** 
1. Click "Trigger Mode" button (not "Live Mode")
2. Verify console shows: "Camera is in trigger mode"

### Issue: "Camera not in trigger mode" message
**Solution:**
1. You're in "Live Mode"
2. Click "Trigger Mode" button to switch

### Issue: "camera_manager not found" error
**Solution:**
1. Application didn't initialize properly
2. Restart with: `python run.py`

### Issue: Message not received
**Solution:**
1. Check TCP connection in Controller tab
2. Verify sensor device is sending data
3. Check network connectivity

## Quick Reference

**Problem:** Camera not triggering from TCP command  
**File to Fix:** `gui/tcp_controller_manager.py`  
**Lines to Change:** 200-251  
**Key Change:** Use `camera_manager.current_mode` instead of `tool_manager.get_tool_by_name()`  
**Deploy:** Copy fixed file to Raspberry Pi and restart  
**Test:** Send "start_rising" message in trigger mode  

---

🎉 **FIX COMPLETE - READY FOR DEPLOYMENT** 🎉

**Run on Raspberry Pi:** `python run.py`  
**Test:** Send trigger command from sensor  
**Expect:** Camera auto-captures frame 📸
