## 📝 WHAT WAS DONE

### Old Structure (BEFORE)
```
✅ detect_tool_manager.py (OLD - 693 lines)
   └─ Heavy, had issues with structure
✅ detect_tool_manager_simplified.py (NEW - 634 lines)
   └─ Clean, fixed version
❌ DUPLICATION - Two files doing the same thing!
```

### New Structure (AFTER)
```
✅ detect_tool_manager.py (NOW - 634 lines, using simplified code)
   └─ Clean and simplified!
✅ detect_tool_manager_simplified.py (KEPT - for reference)
   └─ Same content as new detect_tool_manager.py
✅ detect_tool_manager.py.backup (BACKUP of old file)
   └─ Safe backup, can restore if needed
```

---

## ✅ CHANGES MADE

### 1. Created Backup ✅
```

detect_tool_manager_simplified.py (reference - 634 lines)
└─ Exactly the same content ✅
```

### Backup Available
```
detect_tool_manager.py.backup  (old - 693 lines)
└─ Can restore if needed ✅
```
