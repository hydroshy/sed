## 🧹 BEFORE vs AFTER

### Before Cleanup
```
Files:
  - Redundant detect_tool_manager versions
  - Multiple backups (.backup, .bak)
  - Temporary fix scripts in root
  - Test/debug scripts in root
  - Log files scattered
  - __pycache__ everywhere

Folders: Mostly clean
Total clutter: Moderate
```

### After Cleanup
```
Files:
  ✅ Single clean detect_tool_manager
  ✅ No backups cluttering
  ✅ No temp scripts in root
  ✅ No test scripts in root
  ✅ No stray log files
  ✅ No Python cache

Folders: Clean & organized
Total clutter: NONE!
```
