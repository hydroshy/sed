## 🛡️ Multi-Layer Safety Features (v2)

### Layer 1: Re-entrance Guard
```python
_cleanup_in_progress = True
# Prevents cleanup() running twice
# Prevents double-deletion of Qt objects
```

### Layer 2: Exception Handling  
```python
except RuntimeError as e:
    if "wrapped C/C++ object" in str(e):
        pass  # Qt framework already deleted it
# Handles framework-managed cleanup gracefully
```

### Layer 3: Timeout Protection
```python
if not thread.wait(500):  # 500ms max
    thread.terminate()  # Force quit if needed
# Prevents infinite waits
```

### Layer 4: Main Event Loop Timeout
```python
if time.time() - start_time > max_cleanup_time:
    logger.warning("Cleanup timeout - forcing exit")
# Ensures app exits within 2 seconds
```

## ✅ Enhanced v2 Improvements

### What's New in v2

1. **Guard Flag (`_cleanup_in_progress`)**
   - Prevents cleanup from running twice
   - Eliminates double-deletion errors
   - Result: Safe for multiple calls

2. **RuntimeError Handling**
   - Catches "wrapped C/C++ object" errors
   - Knows when Qt has already deleted objects
   - Result: Clean handling of framework cleanup

3. **Timeout Sequence**
   - TCP cleanup first (100ms timeout per thread)
   - Camera cleanup second (can wait longer)
   - Total: 2 second maximum
   - Result: Never hangs, always exits

4. **Graceful Degradation**
   - If cleanup slow: skip remaining steps
   - If Qt object deleted: continue anyway
   - If thread won't quit: force terminate
   - Result: Always exits cleanly

## 🎯 Expected Results

### Clean Shutdown (Expected)
```
INFO - Main window closing - cleaning up resources...
INFO - Application shutting down...
DEBUG: [CameraStream] Cleanup completed successfully
(exits normally in < 2 seconds)

```
✅ No "wrapped C/C++ object has been deleted" errors
✅ No "Exception ignored in threading" messages
✅ No KeyboardInterrupt needed
✅ No hanging on shutdown
✅ Clean exit every time
```
