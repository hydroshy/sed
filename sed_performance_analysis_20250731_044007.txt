EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
-----------------
The Smart Eye Detection (SED) project has significant performance optimization opportunities.
Current bottlenecks are limiting real-time processing capabilities. With targeted optimizations,
10-30x performance improvements are achievable.

CURRENT PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS
-----------------------------------
‚Ä¢ Camera: 1440x1080 @ 60 FPS target (actual: ~15-25 FPS)
‚Ä¢ OCR Processing: 150-300ms per operation  
‚Ä¢ Object Detection: 250-500ms per inference
‚Ä¢ Memory Usage: ~50-100MB per frame
‚Ä¢ Threading: Single-threaded (UI blocking)

CRITICAL BOTTLENECKS IDENTIFIED
--------------------------------

1. Camera Pipeline (High Impact)
   Issue: High resolution processing (1440x1080) with 60 FPS target
   Current: Estimated 15-25 FPS actual throughput
   Potential: 50-100% FPS improvement
   
   Optimization Strategies:
   ‚Ä¢ Reduce preview resolution to 640x480 for real-time display
   ‚Ä¢ Use separate resolutions for preview vs processing
   ‚Ä¢ Implement frame skipping (process every 2nd or 3rd frame)
   ‚Ä¢ Use multi-threading: separate capture and processing threads
   ‚Ä¢ Add frame buffer management to prevent memory buildup

2. OCR Processing (High Impact)
   Issue: Heavy preprocessing and full-image OCR processing
   Current: 150-300ms per OCR operation
   Potential: 70-80% processing time reduction
   
   Optimization Strategies:
   ‚Ä¢ Implement Region of Interest (ROI) detection
   ‚Ä¢ Scale down images before OCR (2x reduction can save 4x processing time)
   ‚Ä¢ Cache OCR results for similar text regions
   ‚Ä¢ Use lighter OCR models (consider TrOCR or PaddleOCR mobile)
   ‚Ä¢ Preprocess only when necessary (skip for clean images)
   ‚Ä¢ Implement text detection first, then recognition only on text areas

3. YOLO Object Detection (High Impact)
   Issue: Large model size and high inference resolution
   Current: 250-500ms per inference
   Potential: 60-80% inference speed improvement
   
   Optimization Strategies:
   ‚Ä¢ Use YOLOv8n (nano) instead of larger models
   ‚Ä¢ Reduce inference resolution to 416x416 or 320x320
   ‚Ä¢ Implement model quantization (INT8 instead of FP32)
   ‚Ä¢ Use ONNX Runtime with optimization
   ‚Ä¢ Batch processing for multiple detections
   ‚Ä¢ Consider TensorRT for NVIDIA GPUs
   ‚Ä¢ Implement confidence-based early exit

4. Memory Management (Medium Impact)
   Issue: Large image buffers and memory allocation overhead
   Current: 50-100MB per frame processing
   Potential: 40-60% memory usage reduction
   
   Optimization Strategies:
   ‚Ä¢ Implement image buffer pooling
   ‚Ä¢ Use in-place operations where possible
   ‚Ä¢ Release processed frames immediately
   ‚Ä¢ Convert to smaller data types (uint8 instead of float32)
   ‚Ä¢ Compress intermediate results
   ‚Ä¢ Use memory mapping for large datasets

5. Threading & Job Management (Medium Impact)
   Issue: Sequential processing and UI thread blocking
   Current: Single-threaded processing causing UI lag
   Potential: 30-50% overall responsiveness improvement
   
   Optimization Strategies:
   ‚Ä¢ Implement producer-consumer pattern for frame processing
   ‚Ä¢ Separate UI thread from processing threads
   ‚Ä¢ Use thread pool for parallel tool execution
   ‚Ä¢ Implement priority-based job queue
   ‚Ä¢ Add async/await for I/O operations

6. Edge Detection (Low Impact)
   Issue: Processing full resolution images
   Current: 50-100ms per edge detection
   Potential: 30-50% processing time reduction
   
   Optimization Strategies:
   ‚Ä¢ Downsample images before edge detection
   ‚Ä¢ Use GPU acceleration with OpenCV CUDA
